All through our college,  

a voice is resounding,

Promptly respond to your

duty’s sweet call.

  

Harken you all for the

trumpet is sounding,

Your Mater’s proclaiming

her watchword to all.

  

Forward her children dear,

ever with hearts sincere,

Render with joy to your

Mater her due.

  

All that is vile reject,

heaven will e’er protect

Sons of St Joseph’s

valiant and true!

  

Onward and upward in

life’s earnest battle,

Joyously bearing the

brunt of the fight.

  

Nobly forgiving,

for all that may pain you,

And bravely defending

the cause of the right.

  

Forward her children dear,

ever with hearts sincere,

Render with joy to your

Mater her due.

  

All that is vile reject,

heaven will e’er protect

Sons of St Joseph’s

valiant and true!

<br>



The SJI school motto which is Latin for "**Pray and Work**" reflects the life of Saint Joseph - the man who listens to God, the good husband and loving father, the great teacher of the young, the conscientious worker.

  

The motto calls upon Josephians to be in communion with, and to be guided by God through prayer; and to always work conscientiously in learning and growth, and in service to God, especially in uplifting the last and the least amongst us.

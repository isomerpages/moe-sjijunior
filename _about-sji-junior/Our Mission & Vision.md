<p>The SJI school motto which is Latin for "<strong>Pray and Work</strong>" reflects the life of Saint Joseph - the man who listens to God, the good husband and loving father, the great teacher of the young, the conscientious worker.</p>
<p>The motto calls upon Josephians to be in communion with, and to be guided by God through prayer; and to always work conscientiously in learning and growth, and in service to God, especially in uplifting the last and the least amongst us.</p>

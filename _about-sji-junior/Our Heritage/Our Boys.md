### Stefan Tseng

 1997 to 2002   

**Artiste**


Stefan attributes his success in sports to St Michael’s School Memories of your school years: I remember playing football or running around the school almost all the time, either before school, during recess, or after. I began playing football at Primary 4, and we had an amazing team (with Hariss Harun). Then I started Athletics in Primary 5 because Serjit Singh, the coach back then, asked me to try it out as I did fairly well at Sports Day. Sports Day was always fun because there was always a rivalry in the 100m and 200m with Hariss. It was good fun. Primary 6 was the year I won the Gold medal at National Schools, and broke the record for Triple Jump. A lot of my success can attributed to the conducive environment St. Michael’s School created, where we felt we could achieve anything.

### Andre Ahchak

#### 1968 to 1973   

**Artiste**  
Andre remembers many teachers in St Michael’s who had made a huge impact on him.  
I entered St Michael’s School on the morning of Tuesday 2nd January 1968. My Primary One Teacher was Mrs Lourdes Nathan. I hadn’t had the privilege of going to kindergarten and Mrs Nathan made a great impression upon me in my first year of formal schooling. She was strict, but such a kind person. When she got married, she brought her wedding cake to class to share with us. It was a fruit cake!  
          
There were many teachers in St Michael’s who made a huge impact on me. I learnt from them that nothing was impossible if you worked hard. It didn’t matter whether your family was rich or poor. You didn’t have to be smart, but honest – so that in doing your best you would achieve what you truly deserve.  
          
Here are some teachers whom I’d like to name specifically. Apart from my Primary One A teacher, there was Mrs Leong (her son Benedict Leong was in my class). Mrs Leong taught the Primary One B, class. She was a very motherly figure who was always very cheerful.  
          
Mr Charles Chan, my Primary Two Form Teacher, taught us discipline. He was the school’s Scout Master and he used his Scouting Skills to teach us to assemble (especially during PE) silently. Because of Mr Chan I was also involved in the Gardening Society.  
          
Mr Alex Wong Voon Foo was my Primary 3A Form Teacher (1970). Although he was the Senior Teacher/ Discipline Master and looked stern, Mr Wong had a heart of gold. I’ve kept in touch with him, on and off, these past years.  
          
One teacher who changed my perspective of things was Mr Joseph Varghese. He was my poetry and singing teacher. He got me to participate in the National Inter-Schools Poetry Competition. I didn’t know what it was about but I agreed to participate. I dressed as a pirate and recited a local poem about a blood-thirsty pirate Koo Sheng Fee! Surprisingly I took the top spot in the Open Solo Competition, beating others who were older. That was really news back in school!This opened opportunities for me. I was selected by the Ministry of Education to be trained by a Superintendent of Schools, Miss Janice Baruch. We were given training in elocution, speech, drama, and poetry reading. That year I also joined the SMS Bugle and Fife Band under Ms Leanor Chan and former SMS staff member Mr Ow Mun Hong.  
          
The following year in Primary Four (1971), I was chosen by Miss Baruch to be involved in Radio and Television Poetry Programmes on Channel 5, Radio Television Singapore (RTS). Later that same year I was selected to be a presenter for Educational Television (ETV) Programmes produced by the Ministry of Education at the then Teacher’s Training College at Paterson Road. My programme producer was the famous Miss Tan Si Lai formerly of RTS. (I was a presenter of ETV programmes till I was in Secondary Three in St Joseph’s Institution.)  
          
My Primary Four and Five Form Teacher was Mr Tan Kheng Siang. I still keep in touch with Mr Tan via Facebook. I believe has migrated to Canada. In Primary 5, I was made a School Prefect and was selected to represent St Michael’s to receive the POSB prize from Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, then Minister for Education.  
          
In Primary Six (1973) I was still a Prefect. My Form Teacher was Mr Ow Mun Siong (the elder brother of Mr Ow Mun Hong my band instructor). The older Mr Ow was popularly known as ‘Gala’ because of his height. That year, other than preparing for the PSLE, I participated in the National Day Parade at the Jalan Besar Stadium with the SMS Band. I was also involved in the National Safety First Council Story-telling Competition, finishing in the top ten of all the primary schools in Singapore.  
          
Some other teachers and staff who made an impression on me during my time at SMS were Mr Joseph Wee (who was also my Confirmation God-Father and a goodfriend of my father’s as they were schoolmates in St Joseph’s Institution and then at the Teachers’ Training College). Mr Joseph Toh was a stern Prefect Master but a wonderfully kind man. Mrs Colleen Sheares, who though always busy at school functions, was always ready with a word of encouragement. Mr James Low, who taught us the hymns for Mass and the School Rally, Mr Tan Wee Lee, whose patience with rascals helped many turn over a new leaf. Brother Vincent, who taught us Catechism in Primary 3, and Brother Godfrey (Francis Paulus) who was a wonderful athletics teacher. Mrs De Souza, the Chief Clerk of the School (whose son Jeremy was in my class) was another kind and loving person. My years at St Michael’s were wonderful and that is why they are still so vivid in my mind! God bless all my teachers and my friends who share those memories with me.

Stefan attributes his success in sports to St Michael’s School  
\- Playing football during recess.  
\- Achieving “C” Division individual champion on sports day 1969.  
\- Academically, never being out of the top 3 in class.  
My favourite teacher was Mrs Sheares who spotted at an early stage (Primary 3) my fondness for reading and got me on my way to my career in media.

### Fr Gerard Weerakoon   

**Ordination: 04th Nov 1996**:
Parish Priest of Church of St Stephen  
  
Born 12th March 1952, Gerard Weerakoon was the only child of Christopher & Constance Weerakoon. Early childhood was spent in Norfolk Rd, within walking distance from St. Michael's School where he attended primary school from 1959 to 1964. There, he was inspired to the brotherhood by the La Salle brothers. The proximity to Novena Church was also helped to influence his religious life.  
  
Gerard moved on to St. Joseph's Institution for his secondary education from 1965 to 1968. While at SJI, Gerard wanted to join the La Salle brothers but was dissuaded by his parents.I remember Gerard as a classmate who was always immaculately dressed in starched and ironed school uniform. The creases on his uniform were still intact at the end of the school day when ours were soiled and sweaty from our day's activities.  
  
After pre­university, Gerard went on to do National Service. He chose to serve as a medic in 6 SIR. Upon ROD in 1973, he joined DBS Bank as a clerk until 1979 when his religious calling got him to leave for the Redemptorist Seminary in Singapore. Six months later, he left the Redemptorists on his own accord to return to the world of banking.  
  
He joined Banca Commerciale Italiana. A year later, left to join NMB Bank, later renamed ING Barrings, remaining there for 7 years and achieved his aim of becoming a bank officer.  
  
The turning point in his life came with the Papal visit of Pope John Paul II to Singapore in November 1986. While at work, Gerard had met and joined some lay people in the Opus Dei ­ "Work of God". The Opus Dei is a lay organization which aims to achieve individual holiness and apostolic commitment through work. He was greatly inspired by his involvement there.  
  
But the calling was still strong and he rejoined the St. Francis Xavier Seminary in Ponggol in 1989. On 4th November 1996, Gerard was ordained Fr. Gerard Weerakoon at the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, his parish church, as the family had already moved to Lim Tua Tow Rd. His mother still lives there. He was posted to the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour until the re­posting.  
  
Fr. Gerard Weerakoon joins the Church of St. Francis Xavier on 23rd June 2003, his second posting since priesthood. The posting is for three years with effect from 15th June.  
  
Asked about his vision for SFX, Fr. Weerakoon says this, "The laity is called to holiness. The priest is to serve them and inculcate the values of virtue, charity, etc." He wants to help to laity to be saints; to achieve peace and happiness and to accept pain and suffering cheerfully.  
  
Fr. Weerakoon hopes to visit ALL the families in the parish (population 4,500), some one thousand homes, within the three years of his posting.  
  
And what about Fr. Weerakoon's favourite interest? Home cooked food! He prefers this to restaurant food. Most of the farewell dinners given by his OLPS parishioners were home cooked meals. And I am sure that the cuisine in Serangoon is a lot better than Siglap!  
  
One last note ­ Fr. Weerakoon seems to have a mystical number 7. He was with DBS for 7 years. He was with ING Barrings for 7 years. He was in the seminary for 7 years. He was with OLPS for 7 years.  
  
7 is the Perfect Number in Christianity. Coincidence?

**Reflections through email: I can't recall much except that the school was near my house and I enjoyed walking to school.  
The Principal was Brother Basil who was very strict.He came to our class every week to check our report cards.  
He carried a cane but I did not get any caning.  
From Primary 1 to 5 I took Mandarin and was quite proficient, learning to write in the long from.**

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Generation of Boys</strong></p>

A renowned institution of education has just carved an illustrious path, bridging the 2nd half of the 20th century to the 21st century. In the year 2014 CE, St. Michael’s School has ascended full circle --- spanning 60 years, educating three generation of students with the fourth one steadily on its way.  
  
Today with reverent pride and in the highest esteem we, Sons and Daughters (teachers), honour our Alma Mater by professing ever more our pious love and unbounded loyalty. With eternal gratitude, we embrace the rich heritage she has bequeathed us --- families, society and the nation --- an education unrivalled, strong family values, life skills and an unwavering faith in God.  
  
Right here with loving memories, we fondly reminisce, the heyday of St.Michael’s School, our Alma Mater; her maternal mantle like an invisible cloak still shielding her sons wherever they are –the ever nurturing mother!  
  
For close to six decades the tropical sun casts its brilliant rays, gilding the bold letters of the inscription  
  
\--- St. Michael’s School  
\--- emblazoned across one white wall. A wrought-iron gate connects this wall to another, marking the main entrance to the large school grounds, at Essex Road.  
  
Just a little beyond the gate, at a respectable distance, the statue of St Michael, the Archangel – the patron saint – clad in a knight’s armour with a lance poised to strike at the infernal serpent at its feet – stands as a silent sentinel; a symbol of good over evil.  
  
Today the name “St. Michael’s” affectionately called ‘St. Mike’, gave way to the new name - “St. Joseph’s Institution Junior.”  
  
The transitional change in 2007 was swift and almost seamless with a short initiation ceremony. The signficance of which change was justifiably explained.  
  
Nevertheless, it stirred up in the hearts of the “old boys and teachers, a great flurry of sentiments – spoken and unspoken – most bemoaning the nostalgic loss of a much loved, memorable scholastic past. After all, it was for the students an intimate part of their childhood as their playground.  
  
In the grand fabric of life, it is only the hem – the change of name, that is. As the Shakespearean adage goes – “A rose by any other name, smells just as sweet.”  
  
Indeed, even as we muse about these events, the image of St Michael’s, now.  
  
St Joseph’s, appears large and towering – we are not referring to the structure alone per se. It still stands institutionally grand with the same indomitable spirit, continuing the revered La Sallian tradition of education, that could only be envisioned by a saint – St. John Baptist de La Salle, some four centuries ago.

### The Signum Fidei


The Signum Fidei or Sign of Faith is the symbol shared by the Christian Brothers’ Schools in Singapore. At the heart of the symbol is a star, a reminder of the Star of Bethlehem which guided the three wise men to the manger where Christ was born. Its significance for Lasallians is to remind them to centre their lives on God, manifesting their faith through service to others. Hence the 3 values associated with our Lasallian Brothers are Faith, Service and Community. As a Christian Brothers’ School, we are tasked to manifest these values in what we do for the school and the community at large.

### Religious Brothers as Principals


The school’s religious ethos was propagated by its religious principals in the formative years, with Brother Thomas Dunne being the first Brother-Principal in 1954, followed by Brother Basil Voon in 1956. Successive lay Principals never lost sight of the spiritual character of this Christian Brother School amidst the pursuit for excellence—that of living out the Gospel so that each child who enters its gates would gradually become the person that God wants him to be.  
  
While many would cherish memories of catching spiders or fishing for tadpoles in stagnant drains in the school premises, pioneer Michaelian, Goh Kim Chwee, counts the spirituality of the school as most memorable. He regarded the late Brother Basil as a Principal and a spiritual Father of the school. The Christian values taught through the Parables in the Bible taught during Catechism classes were embedded in him, helping him throughout his working life. He also recalled how non-Catholic children, together with their Catholic peers would say the daily prayers faithfully with their teachers before the first lesson began in the morning, before and after recess, at noon, with the recitation of the Angelus, and the final prayer just before the last lesson of the day.

### Blessing of the School in the 1990s


Amidst its various school development programmes and restructuring, the school never lost sight of its focus on holistic education, including the spirituality of its staff and students. On 28 May 1992, the then Archbishop Gregory Yong blessed the school in a simple yet moving ceremony, concelebrated by past students who have become priests. In the presence of parents, Christian Brothers and Principals of the CBS schools, the then-Principal, Mr Dominic Yip, together with the staff, pledged their steadfast loyalty to the school and in realising the ideals of St John Baptist De La Salle. After the next major redevelopment of the St Michael’s School building was completed in 2003, Archbishop Nicholas Chia, together with six other Michaelian-priests concelebrated the Blessing Mass. As part of this redevelopment, the St. Michael’s School Chapel was constructed where Masses and Catechism classes were held.

### Spiritual Life of the School in the 2000s


In 2007, in line with its school vision of being “A choice Catholic school where boys are nurtured to trust in God, believe in themselves, thrive in a global environment and be of service to others”, the school implemented a variety of initiatives to realise it, bolstered by the efforts of Brother Edward Seah, Catholic teachers, Parent Volunteers who were involved in the Parents’ Prayer Group. The Catholic Students’ Society met weekly where they had Bible sharing and Praise-and-Worship sessions. The boys also led prayers in the Holy Hour as well as led Morning prayers and took charge of Masses held in school. Every term, the boys would also visit the St Joseph’s Home for the Elderly to chat with the residents, assist them during meals and facilitated in art-and-craft sessions.  
  
In 2008, a Prayer Room was built to support the prayer life of the Catholic community in the school. The Room was blessed by Father Gerard Louis from the Novena Church.  
  
The Catholic teachers continued to enliven the Catholicity of the school by imparting Catholic values through poems, stories, video clips from YouTube and music videos. The Catholic teachers and parent volunteers also taught the boys correct prayer etiquette through special prayer sessions held during Lent and the Month of the Rosary in May and October. In 2009, the school restored the St. Michael’s statue to its former glory and also acquired a beautiful statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  
  
In 2012, despite the lack of a proper Prayer Room and Chapel in the Geylang Bahru campus, the parent Catechists enhanced the Catholic identity of the school through their myriad initiatives. They not only took the trouble to transform two rooms into places of solace and contemplation for the boys to pray in, these Parent Volunteers also took the trouble to pray with the Catholic boys at recess times and throughout the duration of the PSLE. They took the trouble to put on an Easter play for the Primary 1 to 3 pupils and play an active role during school Masses, besides conducting Catechism lessons. Their dedication to helping the Catholic boys appreciate the importance of prayer is truly inspiring and appreciated by many.

### Spiritual Outreach


In 2014, the school launched Project Good, a Lenten project which aimed to raise funds for the Lasallian Missions to help the less fortunate students in other countries. The boys were made aware of the plight of thousands of boys and girls who are deprived of proper education and which the LaSalle schools are helping to resolve. The project ran from 31 March to 4 April and the boys were exhorted to give up part of their recess money and donate at least one dollar to the project. This project was also in line with the Lenten observance of charity and almsgiving and also the Lasallian values of service and community. The project was officially launched on 31 March, where principal, Mr Timothy Goh started by putting in one dollar into the donation box on stage, followed by various representatives from the school community such as the Religious and Moral Education Coordinator and Head Prefect. Each day during recess, Parent Volunteers helped to “man” the donation box and rang a bell to draw attention to the Project Good donation box, encouraing the boys to donate  
  
On Founder’s Day on 7 April, Project Good concluded with a slide show of the Bamboo School in Thailand. The boys were shown how the students there lived and studied in the school despite their poor living conditions. Finally, a cheque was presented by Mr Timothy Goh on behalf of the whole school to Brother Dominic Chong who represented the Lasalle Brothers and who would give the donations to the Lasallian Missions.

### Care for the School, Care for the Environment


On the service front, the Primary 1 and 2 pupils continued the canteen-adoption programme which was started in 2006. These young Josephians took pride in keeping the canteen litter free after each recess and cultivated good habits of care and concern for the school environment.  

### Community Involvement Programme


The Primary 3 to 6 Junior Josephians put in at least an hour each school term in a big clean-up of their classrooms which we hope could instil a greater sense of belonging and bonding within the school community. Besides the quarterly spring-cleaning events, the boys and teachers were invited by a group of SMU students in the first quarter of the school year to donate their storybooks to the children of Janata Primary School in Nepal. The Primary 6 boys also embarked on some meaningful post-PSLE Community Involvement Programme (CIP) for the very first time for 3 days in October, cleaning the Novena Church and the 1-room flats of the lonely elderly residing at Toa Payoh South.  

### Community Outreach


The CCA groups had a variety of community service both within and outside school. The Chinese Cultural Club members shared Chinese New Year festive joys presenting bags full of daily necessities after an afternoon of songs and interactive games with the elderly under the care of Xin Yuan. The Photography Club members, Scouts and the Chess Club members assisted in Xin Yuan’s Flag Day and fundraising activities within our school. The Innokids and Prefects prepared bags of fruits and vegetables in August and November to spread the message of healthy-living to the elderly and needy families in Toa Payoh. The Modern Dance group visited and helped in the cleaning of Rama Krishnan Mission Home. The Hockey players went on a litter-picking session at MacRitchie – the school’s adopted reservoir for a period of two years. The Band and AVA members polished musical instruments and cleaned up the AVA equipment during the holidays. The Soccer players and swimmers from the Swimming CCA put in a few minutes after each training session picking up litter within the school compound and at the Jalan Besar Swimming Complex respectively. The InfoComm Club members put their creativity and IT skills to work designing ‘Season’s Greetings &amp; Thank You’ cards for Xin Yuan Community Care, while the Robotics Club, Athletic members and Powerkids ‘flexed their arm-muscles’ in the preparation of Christmas decoration for the Christmas Appreciation lunch for Xin Yuan’s beneficiaries and donors to be held in December.Teachers were not left behind when it comes to community effort. The Mother Tongue teachers raised funds for the purchase of groceries while the Primary 6 teachers did the ‘marketing’ and donated generously when the funds raised was not sufficient to provide for 60 needy families. The Primary 4 teachers started a production line packing 60 bountiful bags of items during one long afternoon and our ‘Santa Clauses’ were none other than our Primary 1 and 2 teachers who delivered the goodies bags door-to-door to two blocks of one-room flat residents in May. The Primary 3 and 5 teachers donated and hand-delivered 40 generous packs of fruits and vegetables to share our National Day joys with the elderly in August.  
  
In 2009, the school continued its efforts to help the boys understand the school values of Empathy and Fraternity through donations to various organisations as well as the organisation of ‘Hair for Hope with a Twist’, a modified version of the Children Cancer Foundation’s (CCF) ‘Hair for Hope’ which aimed for members of the public to show their support to children with cancer by shaving their heads. The modification was the result of the H1N1 epidemic that struck the nation that year. Through the sale of tulips, tulip pots and outright donations, the school raised a total of $19,000. As a result of its efforts in character formation, the school received the MOE Character Development Award.  
  
In 2010, together with the PTA, the school organised a ‘Friends’ Forever’ fund-raising carnival held on 3 July. One of the highlights of the carnival was CCF’s ‘Hair for Hope’ event which saw 61 shavees volunteering to have their heads shaved. Among them were the then vice-principal, Mr David Ching, Mr Jason Dendroff, then President of the PTA, teachers, parents and students. The event even received press coverage in the Chinese national papers the following day. A week prior to the ‘Hair for Hope’ event, letters to parents were sent out by the school to create awareness of Childhood Cancer, and also to seek the kind support of parents and students by pledging monetary support generously to all the brave SJI Junior Volunteer Shavees coming forward to have their heads shaved for a good cause. Collection of monetary pledges was carried out by form teachers from 29 June to 16 July 2010 in the school. Daily ten-minute sharing aimed at raising awareness about Childhood Cancer were also conducted before the school flag-raising ceremonies to enable the students to better understand childhood cancer and how they could do their part to help those less fortunate than them. The total amount raised by SJI Junior that year was $40,000. All monetary pledges were donated to CCF to help children with cancer and their families.  

### Men of Others


In 2011, to enhance the boys’ ability to be of service to others, the school embarked on a pupil leadership programme which provided the boys opportunities to acquire leadership skills and apply them. Functional Leadership positions, where boys took on operational roles in the classroom, were complemented with the relevant training. At the same time, boys who displayed leadership potential in their CCAs were accorded roles too. By increasing the number of leadership positions available in the school, many more boys were given the opportunity to take charge. Their capacity was further enhanced through quarterly Focus Group Discussions and Leadership Camps for P2 and P4 boys.  
  
The Prefects too, sharpened their saw through Focus Group Discussions and went through regular training sessions. A high point for them must surely be their visit to SAFTI where they had a first-hand experience of servant leadership. Their training was put to the test when they completely took charge of the Teachers’ Day celebrations and discharged themselves admirably.  
  
To develop the students to be “Men for Others”, the school raised their awareness about the plight of the less fortunate. The awareness bore fruit as evidenced by the abundance of donations in cash to the Catholic Welfare Services and the various flag days, or in kind for instance, through the donations of new stationery to orphanages and Children’s Home. The school managed to incorporate a CIP visit for our Choir boys to a Children’s Home in Taiwan and in a donation drive among the P1 and P2 boys, their contributions amounted to 38 boxes worth of stationery to three orphanages in Singapore – such was the generosity of our parents and students!  
  
Having a heart for the elderly was also cultivated through the school’s Hydroponics Programme where the P4 boys grew and harvested vegetables that were suitable to the elderly palate and later made house visits to deliver the vegetables to the residents in the Toa Payoh district. The boys also played host to the elderly from AWWA who joined the school community in the National Day celebrations and relived their youth through the traditional games and food items that the school arranged as part of its National Day celebration.  
  
In 2012, the school reached out to its new neighbours in the Geylang Bahru vicinity. The Robotics Club set up a display booth at the Moulmein-Kallang GRC and Whampoa SMC Sports Carnival 2012 held at Kallang Community Club on 15 July, which was well-received by 2000 residents who turned up for the event. The Champions of the Primary 2 and Primary 3 Interclass Chinese Story Telling Competitions were also roped in to entertain and impress the Kolam Ayer community during the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration when they told their winning stories on stage.  
  
In 2013, the school focused on extending care to the environment. The lower primary boys focused more on care for their immediate environment through keeping their classrooms clean. The Primary 4 boys progressed to learning to care for the Elderly through the monthly “Healthy Hydroponic Spinach for the Elderly” Project in which a Primary 4 class would be scheduled to cultivate hydroponic spinach, after which, the pupils would harvest and pack the spinach for delivery to the elderly beneficiaries of Xin Yuan Community Care, a welfare organisation in Toa Payoh, which is one of the community partners of the school. The Primary 5 boys were entrusted with the responsibility of playing big brothers as they each partnered a Primary 1 boy and be their “Recess Buddy” for the first two weeks of the new academic year, showing them how to buy food in the canteen during recess time. Staff of SJI Junior, the main drivers of the CIP in the school, also participated in CIP through community service in non-profit organisations at the end of the work year.  

### Values in Action


2014 saw a rebranding of CIP. In its place was Values in Action (VIA) which are learning experiences that support pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, pupils reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>School Activities</strong></p>

**SCOUTS**
	

St Michael’s Scouts Cub was the first uniform group for many Michaelians. It was an exciting CCA for many Michaelians marked by campfires in the school fields, and overnight camps in the school. The St Michael’s Scouts Cub gave many Michaelians their first-hand experience at outdoor living.  
![scouts-1.jpg](/images/scouts-1.jpg)  

**BAND**


It all began with a few pupils in long white socks and smart polished black boots. Each pupil carried an instrument in his arms. That was how the SMS Marching Band started, with Mr James Low.  
  
![Band-1.jpg](/images/Band-1.jpg)  
The SMS Marching Band made its official performance during the Athletics Meet in 1970.Since then, the SMS Marching Band has progressed to become an impressive performing group in the school. With times, it has taken a new mode of operation.  
  
![Band-2.jpg](/images/Band-2.jpg)  
  

**CHOIR**


Performing is a natural part of Michaelians. The Choir started out as a singing time in the school. It grew in size as many pupils started showing talents.  
  
![Choir.jpg](/images/Choir.jpg)  

**ART CLUB (ART ACTIVITIES)**


Art Club first started back in the 60s, and has brought out many artists in the school. These days, it is still is a popular CCA.

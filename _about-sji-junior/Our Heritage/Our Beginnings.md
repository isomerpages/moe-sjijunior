<p style="text-align: center"><strong>The Brothers in Singapore</strong></p>

In 1852 the Brothers of the Christian Schools came to Singapore to start their first school here. It was Father Jean­Marie Beurel who was instrumental in persuading the Brothers to do so.  
  
He left France and arrived in Singapore on 27 October 1839 to work in the Mission of Siam (which included Singapore). He obtained a grant of land from the colonial government and started working on constructing a larger church for the then growing Catholic community. This has since become the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd.  
  
He wanted to open a school for boys, which would be managed by the Brothers of the Christian Schools. He rationalised that the school was necessary for implanting a truly Christian faith in the hearts of children.

Give me this grain of mustard seed and perhaps a fine tree will grow out of it. Give me a little leaven and perhaps my dough will become ready to make an excellent bread. Everything must have a beginning, even the Most gigantic things in nature”  
  
Fr Beurel, Jan 1849, in a letter to Fr Albrand, Director of the Seminary of Foreign Missions in Paris, asking for the Brothers to come  

Beurel left for France on 28 October 1850 to engage in discussions with the relevant authorities on his school building mission. While in France, he took the opportunity to convince the Reverend Mother Superior General of the Infant Jesus Sisters, Mother de Faudoas, to send some sisters to Singapore to begin a school for girls. On his return to Singapore on 29 March 1852, Beurel brought along with him an initial team of six La Salle Brothers and four Infant Jesus sisters.  
  
In 1852, Beurel founded St. Joseph's Institution (present­day Singapore Art Museum). Beurel used his own money to purchase a house at the corner of Victoria Street. On 5 February 1854, Beurel started the first Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in this house that he had bought (present­day CHIJMES).5

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Our Alma Mater's Call</strong></p>

The melody of the school rally, 'Alma Mater’s Call', has its origin in an early 19th century Irish march tune composed by Joseph Haliday, a bandmaster of the Cavan Militia. He was from Carrick-On-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland. In 1810, he patented the keyed bugle, with five keys and a compass of twenty-five notes, calling it the 'Royal Kent Bugle'. He died in 1846 at the age of 71 in Dublin.  
  
  
In 1843, Michael Joseph McCann (1824-1883) from Galway gave lyrics to the tune and published it in The Nation (an Irish nationalist weekly newspaper founded in 1842) as 'The Clan Connell War Song'. It was also known as 'The Tyrconnell War Song', but was more popularly known as 'O’Donnell Abu' (translates to O’Donnell Forward or O’Donnell To Victory).  
  
McCann’s lyrics portray the call-to-arms of Irishmen in the Nine Years War (1594 – 1603), when Hugh O’Neill (2nd Earl of Tyrone) and Hugh Roe O’Donnell (Lord of Tyrconnell) challenged Elizabethan rule in Ireland.  
  
Written at a time of the Great Famine that ravaged the countryside and in a century that was marked by an intense resistance against British rule, the song was a rebellious cry to change the status quo. When Ireland gained her independence from Britain in the early 1920s, the song nearly became Ireland’s National Anthem, losing only to 'The Soldiers’ Song' on votes.  
  
Alma Mater’s Call is an adaptation of O’Donnell Abu. The lyrics were written by Irishman Bro. Marcian James Cullen (1869 – 1938). He was the Principal of St. Joseph’s College, Hong Kong, in the early 1910s; Director of St. Xavier’s Institution, Georgetown, Penang and St. Michael’s Institute, Ipoh; and Director of St. Joseph’s Institution, Singapore, from 1922 to 1927. A picture of him can be found on page 51 of the book Living The Mission: The SJI Story, 1952-2002. He passed away at the age of 70 and his remains were laid to rest in the Christian Brothers Mausoleum in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. One of SJI’s current four fraternities is named after him.  
  
The original version of Alma Mater’s Call has four verses.

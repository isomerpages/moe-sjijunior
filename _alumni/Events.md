### SMSAA Annual General Meeting


7 March 2015, 2.30pm

A great BIG thanks to all members who turned up for the SMSAA AGM on the 7th March 2015 at SJI Junior. It was good catching up with fellow Michaelians and an even more engaging exchange of ideas and suggestions to grow the alumni along with a better understanding of the school's plans and areas where it needs assistance.

  

Special thanks to SJI Junior Principal Timothy Goh for his support, Vice-Principal Linda Lau and Mrs Colleen Sheares for arrangements for the AGM, George Kheng for his support and lending a hand and Robert Seng for photos (available at the [SMSAA Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F267291913380728%2F)).

Thank you for your interest in our school!!

To seek admission to SJI Junior, most pupils would have to register through the&nbsp;[MOE P1 Registration exercise](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration). The exercise is usually conducted in July before the year of admission to Primary 1.

For pupils who are unsuccessful in securing a place in our school in the MOE P1 Registration exercise and wish to be on our waitlist, please submit this form AFTER securing a place in another school.&nbsp; We will only process forms for students who already have a place in another MOE primary school.

Upon successful submission of the form, you will see the message “Thank you for filling up the form”. This serves as the acknowledgement of receipt of the application form. The school will only contact you should a vacancy be available for your child.

Applications on the waitlist will need to be renewed every year as the school will not assume that there will be continued interest in the school.

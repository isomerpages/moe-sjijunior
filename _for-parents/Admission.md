Thank you for your interest in our school!!

  

To seek admission to SJI Junior, most pupils would have to register through the [MOE P1 Registration exercise](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration). The exercise is usually conducted in July before the year of admission to Primary 1.

  

To apply for a place in SJI Junior outside the MOE P1 Registration exercise, please fill in this form. The school will acknowledge and will contact you should a vacancy be available.

  

Applications on the waitlist will need to be renewed every year as the school will not assume that there will be continued interest in the school.

<p><strong>SCOUTS<br></strong>St Michael’s Scouts Cub was the first uniform group for many Michaelians. It was an exciting CCA for many Michaelians marked by campfires in the school fields, and overnight camps in the school. The St Michael’s Scouts Cub gave many Michaelians their first-hand experience at outdoor living.</p>

<p><strong>BAND<br></strong>It all began with a few pupils in long white socks and smart polished black boots. Each pupil carried an instrument in his arms. That was how the SMS Marching Band started, with Mr James Low.</p>

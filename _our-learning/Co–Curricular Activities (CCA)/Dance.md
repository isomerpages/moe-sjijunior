<p>Apart from Danceworks 2013, Jovan Tan from 5 Luke took part in the inaugural National Dancesport Championship 2013.</p>
<p>Jovan Tan won 3 Gold Medals in the competition which are -<br>1. Solo Open under 13 Cha Cha<br>2. Solo Open under 13 Jive<br>3. Juvenile Open Cha Cha (partnering with Alexia Soo from East Coast Primary School)</p>
<p>Congratulations to Jovan Tan!</p>
<p>In September, the boys performed for the annual SJIOBA Concert in the Park at Botanical Gardens. This concert is a collaboration done together with the rest of the ST. Joseph’s Schools family.</p>
<p>One knows that it is not only winning that is always important. During their time in the school Dance Club, our boys have not only honed their dancing skills, they have also picked up a lot of values which would help them in later years. This includes working in teams, responsibility, self-discipline and commitment.</p>

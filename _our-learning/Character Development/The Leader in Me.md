The Leader in Me is Franklin Covey’s whole school transformation process. It teaches 21st century leadership and life skills to students and creates a culture of student empowerment based on the idea that every child can be a leader.

  

Instead of seeing children through the lens of a normal distribution curve—some kids are naturally smart and others are not—_The Leader in Me_ paradigm sees that every child is capable, every child is a leader.

  

Stephen Covey’s ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’ is a key component of the overall The Leader in Me process.

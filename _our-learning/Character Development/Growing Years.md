<h4><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE Sexuality Education Programme in SJI Junior (Growing Years Programme)</a></strong></h4>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues. For more information, please visit the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/sexuality-education/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE website</a>.</p>
<p>The goals of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through
the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of
self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours,
development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication,
problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for
others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society,
through the inculcation of&nbsp;<u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u>&nbsp;about
sexuality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The key messages of Sexuality Education for primary schools are:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society</p>
</li>
</ol>

Research shows us that the quickest and most effective way to promote the display of appropriate behaviors is to reward them.The school has introduced this reward system to encourage more of our pupils to be acknowledged for their good behaviour. The pupils have to collect 3 green slips from their teachers who have caught them performing good deeds to receive a bronze award. Further awards are given if the pupils were to collect more slips.

<p>Recognising the potential of how technology can bring about a richer teaching and learning experience, SJI Junior has embarked on a 1:1 computing learning experience, E<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Programme, in 2014. From 2014 to 2017, the E<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Programme was an opt-in programme that was available to Primary 4 to Primary 6 pupils, and it has been a received overwhelming support from parents.&nbsp; For the last two years, the whole level are currently on this programme.</p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/p4technology.jpg">
<p>Today, about 720 students at SJI Junior own a personal learning device for their daily learning, and this number will grow as the benefits of technology integration presents greater opportunities for our students to collaborate, problem-solve, research, and create. We believe these learning experiences will give an advantage to our students' future.</p>
<p>For all the students in the E<sup>3</sup> Programme, they can tap on the campus-wide wireless network that allows staff and students to be connected wirelessly for greater collaboration and communication. All classes that are are also fitted with personal lockers so as to provide greater security to the students' devices.</p>
<p><strong>ROLLOUT FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE IN P3 (2023)</strong></p>
<p>All the information regarding the integration of technology for the Primary 4s will be put online. The school will also be providing information on procurement of the devices, a compulsory parent-child cyberwellness programme as well as a list of the dates that you may want to mark out on so that you do not miss out on any key milestones.</p>
<p>A letter to parents have been issued to you via Parents' Gateway and you can refer to the timeline to take note of the next steps to take.</p>
<p>You can also refer to the guide here as well for your reference.</p>

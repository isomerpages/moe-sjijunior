<p>Recognising the potential of how technology can bring about a richer teaching
and learning experience, SJI Junior has embarked on a 1:1 computing learning
experience, E3&nbsp;Programme, in 2014. From 2014 to 2017, the E3&nbsp;Programme
was an opt-in programme that was available to Primary 4 to Primary 6 pupils,
and it has been a received overwhelming support from parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in 2025, with additional funding support, the devices will be
stored in classrooms on mobile carts for easier access and management.</p>

<p>Today, about 720 students at SJI Junior use a personal learning device
for their daily learning, and this number will grow as the benefits of
technology integration presents greater opportunities for our students
to collaborate, problem-solve, research, and create. We believe these learning
experiences will give an advantage to our students' future.</p>
<p>For all the students in the E3 Programme, they can tap on the campus-wide
wireless network that allows staff and students to be connected wirelessly
for greater collaboration and communication.</p>

<p>As part of this programme, the iPad will be enrolled in Apple School Manager. Each student will be getting an Apple Id account.<br>With that account, each student will be given a free 200 gigabyte iCloud storage account, where you can upload your documents and files. Other things that are included as part of this apple school manager are that the App Store is disabled, meaning to say the students are unable to install any apps from the App Store. The school can also push down apps remotely to be installed for classroom use.</p>
<h4><strong>MDM for Parents and School</strong></h4>
<p>MDM allows the school and parents to control the use of the iPad. </p>
<p><strong>Control Hours of iPad use<br></strong>School Control : 0700-1530 hrs during school days<br>Parental Control : 1530 – 0700 (next day morning), Weekends, School and Public Holidays, HBL Days</p>
<p><strong>School Control<br></strong>During school hours, the teachers are able to control the use of the iPad, monitor their activities and launch the apps on their ipads remotely. Teachers can use in are able to monitor all the students in the classroom where this is an example where you are able to lock the iPads to get the students to focus on the teacher, teachers are also able to launch a specific app for them to actually explore. And teachers also able to project students iPad onto the screen, using Apple TV as well. So these are the things that that enhances the teaching and learning in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Parental Control<br></strong>We have engaged a vendor to manage the use of parental control using the ScreenGuide app. Parents are also able to block their iPads, remove restricted apps, and show only selected apps. Other examples are timeout features where parents can use the app to control the child screen time. Other things include locking device for a set duration of time. Set a recurring schedule, for example, dinner time every day between 6pm to 7pm for example.</p>
